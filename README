TEST SCRIPT

This distribution includes a test script, "test.pl" - running this
script allows you to easily test the module. It will ask for three
fields upon startup:

  YahooID>  A Yahoo! username for the "bot" to sign on with.
  Password> The password to the above mentioned YahooID.
  Contact>  A username for the "bot" to say hello to right when it
            signs on (optional).

The test also displays two ways in which you can send a message with
fonts/colors: doing it the hard way (as in on_connect) or the easy way
(on_im).
